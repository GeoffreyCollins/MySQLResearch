# MySQLResearch

# Overview 
A small database that shows some varying relationships based off of a game that I play quite frequently in my free time. 

I used MySQLWorkbench to get this model done. 

# Relational Database
There were six tables. A lot of one-to-many relationships because of how the game mechanics work but there was a one-to-one relationship for some of them.

# Developmental Environment
As I mentioned above, MySQLWorkbench was used to get this done and used the SQL language to query out data.
